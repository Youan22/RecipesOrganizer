# Overview

In this project, the program allows users to interact with the Recipe Organizer by displaying all recipes, searching recipes by name, and adding new recipes. The recipes are stored in memory using the RecipeOrganizer class, which uses a vector to store the recipes and a map to create a searchable index by recipe name. The code includes stretch challenges such as reading and writing to a file, demonstrating classes, using the new and delete operators for dynamic memory allocation, and leveraging data structures from the C++ STL.
